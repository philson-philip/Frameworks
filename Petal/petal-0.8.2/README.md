Petal is a modern, light CSS UI framework developed at [Shakr](http://shakr.com).

Petal aims to provide an ample set of consistently designed UI components you can easily utilize in your web projects.

Petal is fully coded on LESS from scratch.

## Developing Petal
#### Build Petal
Petal uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) for compiling LESS files to a single `petal.css` file. Run `grunt petal` to compile Petal for a single time. Run `grunt dev` to go into development mode where files in the Petal directory will be watched, building automatically when you make changes to any of the source files. (This will also build the documentation.)

#### Build Docs
Petal's [documentation](http://shakrmedia.github.io/petal/) is built using [Assemble](http://assemble.io/). Run `grunt` (default task) to build Petal and documentation pages for a single time, `grunt dev` for continuous watching and automatic building. The documentation will be built into `docs` folder.

The `dev` task will also run a local webserver based on the `docs` folder. While running the `dev` task, you can access the built documentation at `localhost:9000`. The pages will also livereload when you save any of the watched files.
